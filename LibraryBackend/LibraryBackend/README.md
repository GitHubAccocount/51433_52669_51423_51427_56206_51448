## Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it

```sh
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note the (env) in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal session operates in a virtual environment set up

### Once pip has finished downloading the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
